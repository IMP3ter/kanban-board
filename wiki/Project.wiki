    # This progressbar shows *Project Progress*. It's the ratio of total cards and done cards.
    # Information about total and done cards.

    # *Archive* a project. Click this button when you think a project is done/inactive or old enough. This will be archived and will not show in active project list. You will find this in *archived projects* section. You can restore it to the active projects list by clicking *active* button.
    # *Delete* removes a project. It's not reversible, use carefully!
